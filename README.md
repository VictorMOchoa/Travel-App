# Travel App

## Synopsis
This is the last project in Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. For this project, we were asked to create a travel app that received input from the user and was then sent to a chain of APIs to get the weather, current if the trip is within a week or historical if not. As a bonus, I also utilized the dates entered by the user to calculate how long their trip would be as well as how long from now their trip is. I was also able to retrieve a photo of the destination's country in the case that Pixabay API would retrieve no results for the entered destination.

## Skills used:

 - Node.js
 - Express
 - ES6
 - Webpack
 - Babel
 - Sass
 - JEST
 - Working with multiple APIs
